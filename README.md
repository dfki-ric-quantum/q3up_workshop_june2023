# Q3-up! Industry Workshop June 2023

Welcome to the Q3-up! Workshop. In this repository you will find all materials, exercises and slides
used throughout the two weeks.

## Running the Notebooks
This repository contains jupyter notebooks that will lead you through basic implementations of
simple quantum algorithms and contain exercises for you to train what you have learned.

To run the notebooks, you will need a suitable python environment. The notebooks were tested with
python 3.9 and python 3.11, but any recent python version should be fine. Furthermore you need the
following python modules:

* [pennylane](https://pennylane.ai/), ideally the most recent version 0.30.
* [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) any recent version will be fine.
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) any recent version will be fine.

If you already have a python development environment set up, or have a preferred method of doing so,
you will find a `requirements.txt` file in this folder, that you can simply install with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you haven't worked with jupyter notebooks in the past, checking the
[documentation](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) may be useful.
