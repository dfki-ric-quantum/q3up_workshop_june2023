    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction, Grover's algorithm is able to search for a solution in unstructured datasets. But what does this mean? Let's consider an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Two people are playing a game. Person A thinks of an integer number between 1 and 100. Person B has to guess the number. But person B is only allowed to ask for a single number at a time and person A will only answer with \"Yes, this is the number\" or \"No, this is not the number\".*\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset in this example are all integer numbers 1-100. While in general these numbers of course have a structure, there is no relevant structure in the context of this game. By eliminating one number from the possible solutions (with a guess from B), no new information about the other numbers is gained. \n",
    "\n",
    "(**Side Note**: The situation would be different if person B would be allowed to ask e.g. \"Is the number smaller than 40?\". Then the order of the natural numbers would give a structure to the problem which could be exploited by the search algorithm.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of a problem where finding the solution is hard but verifying a solution is easy (one just has to guess the correct number and A will confirm the solution). In this example person A plays the role of the back box or oracle function. In the classical case, B will need an average of $100/2=50$ guesses to hit the correct number. With Grover's algorithm (provided that the oracle can be formulated as a quantum operation) the correct number can be guessed *with high probability* in only about $\\sqrt{100} = 10$ tries.\n"

    "## Algorithm Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The Grover algorithm consists of three main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State preparation**\n",
    "The initial state of the quantum register is prepared as a superposition of all possible solutions to the problem with equal weights. All solutions are equally likely to be measured. We will call this superposition state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Oracle function**\n",
    "The oracle function is an operator which assigns a *negative phase* to the solution state(s) and leaves the other states untouched. As the phase is not physically measurable, all solutions are still equally likely. We will call the (unknown) solution state $|s\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Diffusion operator**\n",
    "The diffusion operator amplifies the amplitude(s) of the solution state(s) by reflecting the state around $|\\psi\\rangle$. So it leaves the *uniform superposition part* of the state untouched and flips the sign of the amplitude of \"everything else\"."
